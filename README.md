# Concert_Planner
Java project made for the exam of Software Engineering at Universit√† degli studi di Firenze.

The elaborate created is inspired by a real-world problem observed in large amateur groups for musicians.
The application manages the planning of a concert, making it easier for the conductor to choose which pieces to perform. It keeps track of the musicians, their role in the band and their availability for the concert scheduled. The application also lists the pieces in the repertoire, showing whether the requirements for playing them are met or not. These requirements are expressed in the form of conditions that express the type and number of solo instruments needed.
