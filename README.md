# Concert_Planner
Project made for the exam of Software Engineering at Universit√† degli studi di Firenze.

The elaborate created is inspired by a real situation observed in the Giuseppe Verdi Music Band, a large amateur group for musicians located in Montale, Italy.
The application manages the planning of a concert, making it easier for the conductor to choose which pieces to perform. Many of the pieces present in the repertoire require the presence of solo instruments. The situation is accentuated within amateur groups, in which the so-called first parts assigned are markedly more difficult than the others, aimed at more experienced, sometimes semi-professional, musicians.
Therefore the master of the musical body will always have to take into account which musicians are present and decide which pieces in the repertoire can be performed in a given concert.
The work in question is presented as a support tool for the teacher. It keeps track of the musicians, their role in the band and their availability for the concert in question. The application also lists the songs in the repertoire, and in particular it will highlight each song in red or green depending on whether the requirements for playing it are met. These requirements are expressed in the form of conditions that express the type and number of solo instruments needed.
It is also possible to add, edit, and remove musicians, and mark them as present or absent. Similar features are present for the pieces, including the ability to modify or add playability requirements for a piece.
